#CSScaffold

A dynamic CSS framework inspired by Shaun Inman's CSS Cacheer. It's aimed at experienced CSS developers - it gives you the tools to create great CSS easily. It abstracts some repetitive and annoying flaws of the language to make it easier to create and maintain, all while giving you the benefits of caching.

- Constants
- SASS-style mixins
- Compressed, Cached and Gzipped on-the-fly
- Nested Selectors
- Perform PHP operations√•
- Image replace text by just linking to the image file
- Plus easily add your own functionality using the plugin system

##What you need

- PHP5+
- modrewrite enabled in Apache (optional)

##Quick Installation

1. Download the latest release of Scaffold. 
2. Place all the files **inside your css directory on your webserver**. 
3. Navigate to examples/master.css to ensure that Scaffold is working correctly. It should compress the css and add a timestamp to the top of the file. 

Any css files within this css directory will now be parsed by Scaffold automatically. Have a look through the demos in examples/ to get a basic understanding of its different features and read the wiki.

##Available Plugins

Some of the plugins available are:

- [Layout](http://github.com/anthonyshort/Layout/tree/master) - Create 960.gs style grids with Mixins and classes.
- [OOCSS](http://github.com/anthonyshort/Extends/tree/master) - Extend one selector using another selector
- [Browsers](http://github.com/anthonyshort/Browsers/tree/master) - Target specific browsers
- [Icy Compressor](http://github.com/anthonyshort/Icy/tree/master) -  An alternative to Minify

##Templates

Most projects start the same way - create a typography, layout, elements, reset etc stylesheet and go. To skip the steps of rewriting all of that, you can just use some of the templates.
