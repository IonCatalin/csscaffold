##Quick Installation

Download the latest release of Scaffold. Place all the files **inside your css directory on your webserver**. Navigate to examples/stylesheets/master.css to ensure that Scaffold is working correctly. It should compress the css and add a timestamp to the top of the file. Any css files within this css directory will now be parsed by Scaffold automatically. Have a look through the demos in examples/ to get a basic understanding of its different features and read the wiki.
