#CSScaffold

A dynamic CSS framework inspired by Shaun Inman's CSS Cacheer. It's aimed at experienced CSS developers - it gives you the tools to create great CSS easily. It abstracts some repetitive and annoying flaws of the language to make it easier to create and maintain, all while giving you the benefits of caching.
