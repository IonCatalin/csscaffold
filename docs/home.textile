Imagine being able to recreate the 960.gs framework by adding a few settings. How about being able to control the grid of the framework within your css? You can even use dynamic variables based on this grid to enhance your Blueprint-style typography stylesheet and make it infinitely flexible. Oh and that grid.png and grid.css you need to generate every time manually - Scaffold does that for you.

The main goal of Scaffold is to help write less and do more - and then leverage that on future projects. It makes maintaining OOCSS-style CSS much easier.

It is based on Cacheer by Shaun Inman, which passes your CSS through PHP for processing and caching before it reaches the browser.

h2. Features

The best part is that all of this is done transparently. You can drop Scaffold into your site and you'll instantly have access to all of its functionality. 

# Constants
# Mixins
# Nested Selectors
# Generated layout system
# Embed images in your css
# 'if' statements
# Auto-image replacement
# Optimize your selectors and properties
# Caching and gzipping 
# Fully documented (using CSSDoc) examples
# And more

h2. Requirements

Unlike most other CSS frameworks, Scaffold requires a web server. You need PHP 5+ running and that's all.
