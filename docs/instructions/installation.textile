To setup Scaffold on your site, it is usually just a matter of dropping the files in your css folder, setting some paths and changing some permissions.

h2. Step 1 - Copy the /scaffold/ folder.

You can place this folder in any location on your server. We'll need to set up some configuration variables to tell Scaffold where the CSS directory is.

h2. Step 2 - Setting up the paths in system/index.php

The @scaffold/config/config.php@ file holds all of the settings and paths for Scaffold. You need to set each of them.

h3. Cache Lock

Locks the cache so that your CSS can never be recached. This is useful for when you put the site live. 

h3. Show Header

Scaffold prepends a tiny bit of information to the top of the cached CSS file. You can remove that by setting this to false.

h3. Debug

By setting debug to true, you will get information outputted into Firebug using FirePHP. *Make sure this is turned off when you go live*

h3. $css_dir

This is the url path to your css folder. If your css folder was at @http://google.com/css/@ then you need to use "/css" as your path.

h3. $cache_dir

Leave this unless you would like to set something other than the default scaffold/cache/ folder. Use a full server path.

h3. $assets_dir

Leave this unless you would like to set something other than the default css/assets folder. Use a full server path.

h2. Step 3 - Change permissions

You need to make sure the cache folder, @scaffold/cache@ has write permissions.

h2. Step 4 - Add the file to your HTML

To parse your file through Scaffold, you will need to change the links to your CSS files in your HTML to point to Scaffold instead.

<pre><code><link href="screen.css" />
</code></pre>

Becomes:

<pre><code><link href="scaffold/index.php?request=screen.css" />
</code></pre>

*Important* - Scaffold will only cache the file is the screen.css file has been changed. To ALWAYS refresh, add @&recache@ to the end of the url string above. This is useful during development.

h2. Step 5 (Optional)

You can use the CSS files provided as a starting point. The typography stylesheet in particular, is a good template to use on other sites.

You can also setup a .htaccess file (an example is provided inside that css directory), to allow for automatic parsing of any file inside the directory. Just open up example.htacess and change the path @/scaffold/index.php?...@ to the url path to the scaffold/index.php file. Whenever anyone makes a call to a css file in this folder, it will automatically be routed through Scaffold.
