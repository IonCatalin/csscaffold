	Setting constants
		
	Constants can reduce the amount of reused code within your
	css. They are mostly useful for colors, but they can come
	in handy for other things, such as selector groups.
	
	You set constants using @constants and set them like normal CSS
	properties. See the example below.
	
	It's important to know that there is no logic involved in these
	constants. It doesn't matter where they are positioned in the css,
	as they are all pulled out at the start.
	
	You access the constants using:
	
	!constant-name
	
	To see how this renders, open up this stylesheet using scaffold,
	eg. http://localhost/scaffold/index.php?request=stylesheets/demo/constants.css
