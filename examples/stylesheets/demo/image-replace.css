	Image replace
	
	Image replacing content and text is extremely easy. Just use 
	the image-replace property and use a url to the image.
	
	The url is relative to the master css, or the file which was
	originally called by Scaffold. This is important to remember.
	If you get stuck, use an absolute path to the image.
	
	To see how this renders, open up this stylesheet using scaffold,
	eg. http://localhost/scaffold/index.php?request=stylesheets/demo/image-replace.css
